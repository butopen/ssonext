    <p>We are developers and at <a href="https://www.butopen.com">ButOpen.com</a> we needed a quick way to experiment
        with new startup projects.</p>
    <p>Having to <b>re-implement users management every time</b> was tedious and not the core of the project.
        <br>So <b>SSONext</b> was born.</p>
